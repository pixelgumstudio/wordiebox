      title: "How Do You Play Truth or Dare?",
      content:
        "Truth or Dare is a game played verbally with no equipment or cards necessary. A minimum of two people play the game wherein one person chooses to tell a truthful answer to a question set by another player or to perform a challenge usually of bizarre or difficult nature -- a dare. One gameplay option includes using a Truth or Dare generator that'll produce random questions for each player's turn. This ensures that all players have an equal chance of performing an embarrassing task or answering a difficult question. Another optional rule can be to allow players to skip a certain number of truths or dares after verbalization. This rule is valuable if the game is more casual so that a player doesn't have to do anything too far past their comfort zone. A more serious alternative is to only be allowed the choice between the given dare or truth. For example, if the player chooses dare and decides they don't want to do that dare then they must answer a truth provided by the same person even if they don't want to do that either.",

      title: "Dare Questions",
      content:
        "Playing Truth or Dare can be a great way to have a good time at a gathering. It can be fun to do silly things you might never have the courage to do without a little push from someone else. It can also be a blast to watch your friends do some crazy things or to come up with the wild dares you want to see your friends do. A good dare should be something that gets the person a bit out of their comfort zone but not so bad that the person refuses to do it. It can be a tricky balance coming up with these ideas on your own on the fly and that's where a Truth or Dare questions generator can provide good dares for Truth or Dare games. When coming up with dares on your own, remember to always keep dares safe and never do anything that could hurt someone or upset someone's feelings.",

      title: "Truth Questions",
      content:
        "The truth portion of this game at parties can be a fun time too. Maybe it's time to see which teacher your classmates like the most or who believes in the wildest conspiracy theory. Asking who someone likes can be fun at a party but if you want to keep the topic away from romance, there are many other truth questions that can be asked. For example, you can ask instead which movie star they think is the most attractive. Again, coming up with good truth questions for Truth or Dare can be difficult during the game and that's where using a Truth or Dare generator can be quite helpful. It's also important to not forget that certain truths can be hurtful so be careful not to ask people something that could be derisive towards someone you know.",

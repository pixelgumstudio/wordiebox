        "Playing Never Have I Ever is quite simple, but the results can bring out a lot of fun, laughter and sometimes even shock. In the classic game, one person will say an experience that they have never had. If anyone in the group has done the stated activity, they take a shot or take a drink (this can be modified for the group playing, but it originated as a drinking game). If nobody has done the stated action, then the person who made the Never Have I Ever statement must take the shot or drink (or agreed upon action). If only a single person out of the entire group has done the action, they're usually required to elaborate and give details about how the action came about. That's all there is to this game.",

        "Above gives the basic ways on how to play Never Have I Ever, but the Never Have I Ever rules can be easily adjusted to what the entire group agrees upon. One common adjustment is instead of each person coming up with a Never Have I Ever question, the groups uses a Never Have I Ever generator. This often makes the game go more quickly and provides questions that are sure to bring fun and excitement to the game. While it's common for people in the group to drink when they have done the experience, this isn't the main point of the game. The main point is to learn more about the people in the group, so whatever action the person takes to indicate they have had the experience can be negotiated among the group.",
